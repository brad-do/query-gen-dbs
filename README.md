# Overview
[Roots Magic](http://www.rootsmagic.com/) is a popular software tool/database among genealogists.  One awesome feature of the tool is the fact that the back-end is actually a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database, which means you have the ability to access your database outside the constrains of the Roots Magic user interface.

In this project, I've crafted a Jupyter Notebook to load a Roots Magic database and use conventional sqlite tools to query and visualize some of the family tree data.

The code is implemented as a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) and uses [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for the data manipulation part.
